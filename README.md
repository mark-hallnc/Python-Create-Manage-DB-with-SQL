# Python-Create-Manage-DB-with-SQL
This application was my capstone project for Associates degree in computer programming

The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate the ability to work with databases by creating, populating and manipulating data through a sales tracking program. The application was built in steps throughout the last part of the semester, beginning with creating the database. The final project was the SalesApp.py file.
